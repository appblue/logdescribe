# logdescribe
The tool for first pass analysis of the log files and describing the contents, by:

* listing all the fields with sample data
* printing simple statistics for each field in the log
* determining the field with the timestamp (the field matching special regular expression)

Fields in the log files are expected to be separated by the pipe char ("|").
